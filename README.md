# The Impact of N-back-Induced Cognitive Load and Time Budget on Takeover Performance

## Overview: experimental design

This expeirment was the same as the one highlighted in the [gaze_entropy_heterogenous](https://github.com/courtneygoodridge/gaze_entropy_heterogenous) repo, except this analysis focuses on understanding how cognitive load and time budget of a critical event influences eye movements, and timing and quality of takeovers. As per that experiments, participants experienced Level 2 hands-off automation using the University of Leeds driving simulator with their feet and hands away from operational controls. Participants took part in two drives, with each drive containing 10 events. Each event was comprised of 2 minute of automated driving, followed by a takeover request (TOR). Upon the TOR, the driver would have to takeover control of the vehicle and drive manually. 4 events were critical and 6 were non-critical. During one drive, participants completed an auditory 2-back during automated driving; during the other drive they did not. The data analysed in this manuscript focuses vehicle dynamics and eye movement during automation and in the manual driving following a takeover.
